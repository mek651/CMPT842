# Federated Learning with Flower: A Dockerized Approach for Privacy-Preserving Image Classification
Federated Learning (FL) is a distributed machine learning framework enabling multiple clients to train a model collaboratively without sharing their local data. This approach mitigates privacy concerns that arise in traditional centralized learning models. In this paper, we present the application of the Flower framework for an Image Classification task. Flower, a flexible and scalable federated learning platform, facilitates experimentation with heterogeneous devices and machine learning frameworks. Our methodology leverages the CIFAR-10 dataset to train a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model in a federated setting, using Docker for simulation and deployment. The experimental setup involves partitioning data across clients, configuring server and client applications, and evaluating model performance. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of federated learning in maintaining model accuracy while preserving data privacy. This study highlights the importance of FL in scenarios where data centralization is not feasible due to privacy regulations or practical constraints. This hands-on approach showcases the critical role of Dockerization in simplifying deployment, scaling, and managing services while addressing modern computational challenges like data privacy and decentralized machine learning.
